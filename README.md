## fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz example writen in Clojure.

## Usage

Just run and type the length of the sequence of numbers.

```bash
lein run
```

I recomend starting with 100.

### Comment

Just one more fizzbuzz example added to the pile of useless programms.
This one is never the less interesting from a Clojure beginner's point
of view, because it uses a functional style and a macro.
